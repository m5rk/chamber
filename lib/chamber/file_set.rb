# Internal: Represents a set of settings files that should be considered for
# processing. Whether they actually *are* processed depends on their extension
# (only *.yml files are processed unless explicitly specified), and whether
# their namespace matches one of the namespaces passed to the FileSet (text
# after a dash '-' but before the extension is considered the namespace for the
# file).
#
# When converted to settings, files are always processed in the order of least
# specific to most specific.  So if there are two files:
#
# * /tmp/settings.yml
# * /tmp/settings-blue.yml
#
# Then '/tmp/settings.yml' will be processed first and '/tmp/settings-blue.yml'
# will be processed second (assuming a namespace with the value 'blue' was
# passed in).
#
# If there are multiple namespaces, they will be process in the order that they
# appear in the passed in hash.  So assuming two files:
#
# * /tmp/settings-blue.yml
# * /tmp/settings-green.yml
#
# Then:
#
# ```ruby
# FileSet.new files:      '/tmp/settings*.yml',
#             namespaces: ['blue', 'green']
# ```
#
# will process in this order:
#
# * /tmp/settings-blue.yml
# * /tmp/settings-green.yml
#
# Whereas:
#
# ```ruby
# FileSet.new files:      '/tmp/settings*.yml',
#             namespaces: ['green', 'blue']
# ```
#
# will process in this order:
#
# * /tmp/settings-green.yml
# * /tmp/settings-blue.yml
#
# Examples:
#
#   ###
#   # Assuming the following files exist:
#   #
#   # /tmp/settings.yml
#   # /tmp/settings-blue.yml
#   # /tmp/settings-green.yml
#   # /tmp/settings/another.yml
#   # /tmp/settings/another.json
#   # /tmp/settings/yet_another-blue.yml
#   # /tmp/settings/yet_another-green.yml
#   #
#
#   ###
#   # This will *consider* all files listed but will only process 'settings.yml'
#   # and 'another.yml'
#   #
#   FileSet.new files: ['/tmp/settings.yml',
#                       '/tmp/settings']
#
#   ###
#   # This will all files in the 'settings' directory but will only process
#   # 'another.yml' and 'yet_another-blue.yml'
#   #
#   FileSet.new(files:      '/tmp/settings',
#               namespaces: {
#                 favorite_color: 'blue' } )
#
#   ###
#   # Passed in namespaces do not have to be hashes. Hash keys are used only for
#   # human readability.
#   #
#   # This results in the same outcome as the example above.
#   #
#   FileSet.new(files:      '/tmp/settings',
#               namespaces: ['blue'])
#
#   ###
#   # This will process all files listed:
#   #
#   FileSet.new(files:      [
#                             '/tmp/settings*.yml',
#                             '/tmp/settings',
#                           ],
#               namespaces: %w{blue green})
#
#   ###
#   # This is the only way to explicitly specify files which do not end in
#   # a 'yml' extension.
#   #
#   # This is the only example thus far which will process
#   # '/tmp/settings/another.json'
#   #
#   FileSet.new(files:      '/tmp/settings/*.json',
#               namespaces: %w{blue green})

  # Internal: Returns an Array of the ordered list of files that was processed

  ###
  # Internal: Converts the FileSet into a Settings object which represents all
  # the settings specified in all of the files in the FileSet.
  #
  # This can be used in one of two ways. You may either specify a block which
  # will be passed each file's settings as they are converted, or you can choose
  # not to pass a block, in which case it will pass back a single completed
  # Settings object to the caller.
  #
  # The reason the block version is used in Chamber.settings is because we want
  # to be able to load each settings file as it's processed so that we can use
  # those already-processed settings in subsequently processed settings files.
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #   ###
  #   # Specifying a Block
  #   #
  #   file_set = FileSet.new files: [ '/path/to/my/settings.yml' ]
  #
  #   file_set.to_settings do |settings|
  #     # do stuff with each settings
  #   end
  #
  #
  #   ###
  #   # No Block Specified
  #   #
  #   file_set = FileSet.new files: [ '/path/to/my/settings.yml' ]
  #   file_set.to_settings
  #
  #   # => <Chamber::Settings>
